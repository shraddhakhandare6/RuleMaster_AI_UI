# **App Name**: RuleWise

## Core Features:

- Tenant Management: Tenant Management Interface: Allow administrators to create, manage, and isolate tenants within the system.
- User Management: User Management Interface: Allow administrators to add users and permission inside keycloak through the application.
- AI Rule Definition: AI-Powered Rule Definition: Use Gemini via Firebase Functions to interpret natural language input and translate it into structured rules and suggest rule logic.
- Rule editor: Rule Editor: Create an editor with conditions, operators, values, and actions in natural language
- Rule list: Rule List View: Display a list of defined rules with the option to edit, activate, or deactivate them.
- Rule Engine: Rule Engine: Develop a rule engine to evaluate rules against provided data and execute actions, considering prioritization and potential conflicts. Implement Javascript 'tool' capabilities so the AI rule suggestions may include JS expressions if needed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to convey expertise and trust, nodding to the 'master' concept of the app name.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF) to provide a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that doesn't distract from the rules.
- Accent color: Violet (#8A2BE2) to highlight key actions and important information, standing out against the calmer indigo.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text; gives a modern and readable feel. 
- Code Font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) to present javascript functions within the Rules and/or conditions
- Use a set of clear, minimalist icons to represent different types of rules, actions, and data inputs.
- Design a clean, structured layout that facilitates rule definition, editing, and management. Emphasize clarity and ease of navigation.
